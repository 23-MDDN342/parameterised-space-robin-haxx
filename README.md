**Project One: City of Noise**

For this project I aimed to produce a piece of animation that engages with architectural form, initially driven by the idea of projection mapping visual textures onto sculptural or stage-set installations. \
My initial visual goal was something that highlighted the relationship between abstract cyber-aesthetics and more organic design.\
As my process developed, I realised how important it would be to build functions to use as tools to define regions of texture, so a big part of the process was experimenting with what makes the best toolset when writing in code.
These "textures" are regions defined, split uniformy into components (primarily layered squares and rectangles), then coordinated in movement with either smooth animation or spontaneous noise. As the project went on, these two methods worked more hand-in-hand.

I explored different tech-leaning design styles, starting with darker, strobey stuff inspired by DJ visuals - but moving towards using the tools I built to design the final composition for a Zoom background, I decided on a brighter, futuristic cityscape.\
I stuck to one colour to interpolate to and from white, finally adding yellow to the palette to complement the sun animation.

This is a really fantastic combination of what I'd like to be able to apply these tools to. Sculptural architecture pavilion in an outdoor environment that uses ambient sound as well as its contect in a botanical garden to build an incredibly immersive spectacle.

I really like how these visuals use this tiled format in an obviously incredibly fast-paced and dynamic way, but also how negative space and built-up forms are used to give the sense of enclosing/ widening tunnels and such. just so many possibilities for both animation and application.

Another interesting use of music visualization, this came to mind as it breaks up in a rule similar to the golden ratio and alternates between 2d and 3d compositions. I've cited Raven's work before. This was made with Processing. (It's the reason I spent so much time trying to build a quadtree algorithm)

The piece is also known as "189D0", and Raven adapted it for 23 screens of various sizes in a mall interior. \
