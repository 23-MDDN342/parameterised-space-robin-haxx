Progressively built up composition

strategy for colour: nested palette arrays

const pallettes = [\
    [hex1_1, hex1_2, hex1_3],\
    [hex2_1, hex2_2, hex2_3],\
    [hex3_1, hex3_2, hex3_3],\
]\

-"stage counter" for progressively adding visual elements to the composition. \
-this person used a switch statement, which broke it up pretty well,
interestingly enough. this had 5 cases for elements being "deployed".

mycelium/ branches colonizing space

-this code was object-oriented; using classes for different elements.
i will do this too ...\
-a function for growing, similarly to how I have used recursion before.\
-I like how this used the space in a "tiled" format, while implementing
systems for moving parts that interacted to make a varied overall piece.

requirements:\
-consistent rendering at any resolution (scalable) and lends 
 itself to large-format application\
-perfect 24 frame loop and smooth, bug-free performance\
-organised, readable and accessible code standard
 & curated collection of commits. \
-varied use of coded elements and design patterns, creative 
 thought process and execution. unique voice.\
-this document tracks my thought process at every significant step
 and should be able to introduce the work well to a lay-person.\
-open source ethics, always.\
